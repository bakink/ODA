 Description : Multiple correctable ECC errors on a memory DIMM have been
               detected.
 
 Response    : The affected page(s) of memory associated with the faulty
               memory module maybe immediately retired by the operating
               system to avoid subsequent errors.
 
 Impact      : The system will continue to operate in the presence of this
               fault. The memory DIMM is still in use and is not disabled.
               The memory DIMM is disabled on next system reboot and remains
               unavailable until repaired. System performance may be
               impacted slightly due to retired memory pages.
 
 Action      : Please refer to the associated reference document at
               http://support.oracle.com/msg/SPX86A-8002-XM for the latest
               service procedures and policies regarding this diagnosis.
Using the location shown in the output above, you can clear the problem log entry as follows:

 faultmgmtsp> fmadm repair /SYS/MB/P1/D0
 faultmgmtsp> fmadm faulty -a
 No faults found
 faultmgmtsp>
 faultmgmtsp> exit
Now, the SP must be reset

> reset /SP
That's it, done
